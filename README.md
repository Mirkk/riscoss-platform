# Introduction

The [RISCOSS project](http://www.riscoss.eu) will offer novel risk identification, management and mitigation tools and methods for community-based and industry-supported OSS development. 

RISCOSS will deliver a decision-making management platform integrated in a business-oriented decision-making framework, which together support placing technical OSS adoption decisions into organizational, business strategy and broader OSS community context.

This is the main repository for the RISCOSS Platform code.

# Project structure

The project structure reflects the structure of the RISCOSS Platform architecture:

* riscoss-platform-dm contains the code of the Domain Manager (DM)
* riscoss-platform-rdr contains the code for the Risk Data Repository (RDR)
