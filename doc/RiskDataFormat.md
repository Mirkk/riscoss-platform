# Risk Data Format

Risk drivers are represented as one of three data types, `NUMBER`, `DISTRIBUTION`
and `EVIDENCE`.

## NUMBER

`NUMBER` is a simple integer or decimal value based on it's meaning.

## DISTRIBUTION

A `DISTRIBUTION` is an array of decimal numbers, the sum of these numbers must be equal to one.
TODO: **I have no idea what the values of these numbers mean**

## EVIDENCE

An `EVIDENCE` data type is made up of six discrete components:

* **strength**: No idea what this is TODO
* **direction**: No idea what this is TODO
* **signal**: No idea what this is TODO
* **conflict**: No idea what this is TODO
* **negative**: No idea what this is TODO
* **positive**: No idea what this is TODO
